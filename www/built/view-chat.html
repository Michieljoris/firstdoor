<p>A first implementation of one admin to many chat system.</p>

<h3>How to use:</h3>

<p>When the page is loaded for the first time you choose a username to
identify yourself with. Any messages after that are sent to a user
that has named him/herself 'admin'.</p>

<p>The admin can see all the messages entered by all users. Ordinary
users only see their own messages and the ones coming from the admin
user.</p>

<p>When the admin enters a message it goes to everybody, if the admin
wants to address one user in particular he has to prefix the message
with the username followed by a colon (:). So like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>peter:Hello from the admin!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually to be an admin you will have to enter a password. But for
now there is no authentication yet.</p>

<p>The idea is that you can have the web page open in your
browser/tablet/phone and that it will play a sound if there is
communication from somebody. You can then provide instant and
obligation free advice and help to whoever started typing in this box.</p>

<p>I can disable it if there is no admin logged in so that people don't
sit there waiting for a response.</p>

<p>Also I can make a tab per communication channel, so you can switch from
person to person, and address people directy in their tab without
having to prefix your messages with username:. </p></div>
