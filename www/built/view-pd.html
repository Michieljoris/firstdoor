<h2>Developing cooperative behaviour</h2>
<p>This workshop provides educators with strategies to refocus their approach to unacceptable behaviour, and proactively develop cooperative behaviour.

</ul>
<h4>Understanding the child and their behaviour:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understanding from the child's perspective. What does the child want/need/expect to happen?</li>
<li>Observe and analyse behaviour to identify triggers and patterns.</li>
<li>Use reflective practice to analyse the child's needs and their reinforcers or consequences which are maintaining the behaviour.</li>
<li>Review program routines and timetabling for possible influence on behaviour</li>
</ul>
<h4>Develop, implement and evaluate a plan for cooperative behaviour</h4>
<ul>
<li>Interpret the child's behaviour with other involved educators and relevant others.</li>
<li>Work in partnership with parents, and develop a plan collaboratively, in accordance with philosophy and policies of the service</li>
