<h2>Recognition of Prior Learning</h2>
<p>Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a process where a student may be granted credit towards a qualification in recognition of skills and knowledge gained through formal or informal training, work and/or life experience. RPL is offered to any student who can provide evidence of competency for the units offered within the Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care qualification.</p>
<p>During the enrolment process a potential Learner may complete a checklist and discuss any prior evidence before commencing training to determine if they are eligible for RPL. To receive a RPL for a unit requires thorough assessment processes. To display RPL competency, students may need to: collect and provide evidence, complete a workbook and/or be observed in the workplace.</p>
<p>For additional information relating to RPL for this course, please contact:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">First Door RPL Coordinator<br />email: <a href="mailto:admin@firstdoor.com.au">admin@firstdoor.com.au<br /></a><span style="color: #000000;">ph</span>one: 3103 2336</p></div>

<h2>Training Plans</h2>
<p>You will have three years to complete your Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care course from your enrolment date.&nbsp; We have a continual intake of students on this basis throughout the year. For more information on choosing your best suited training plans please refer to your First Door course guide.</p>
<p>Please note: <em>Unit HLTAID004 Provide an emergency first aid response in an education and care setting</em> is to be completed through an accredited first aid training provider. You will need to provide your First Door assessor with your certificate of attainment for this unit to complete the Diploma course. First Door therefore provides training and assessment for 27 of the 28 units required for the Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care.</p>
<h3>Flexi training plan</h3>
<p>The Flexi plan suits students that are eligible to RPL several course unit/s, are highly self-motivated and need flexibility to set their own assessment due dates. Flexi students set their own timetable providing they are able to complete the course within three years. The flexi course follows the four part course structure excluding any RPL units.</p>
<p>The monthly meeting with the student&rsquo;s personal mentor enables goal setting and assessment due dates to be established. Where possible, Flexi students choose units that are in sync with the structured plan so that they can attend relevant workshops. Flexi student are encouraged to attend at least 18 of the 27 workshops provided for this course.</p>
<h3>Structured training plan</h3>
<p><strong>Monthly timetable</strong><br />The structured plan provides students with a monthly timetable to work through a course unit each month from February to November. Our structured plan allows for the 27 units to be completed within three years combining part time study and work experience. Studying using this plan assists students to stay focused and motivated.</p>
<p>One unit is completed each month, excluding the months of December and January each year. At the beginning of each month, students receive their new unit resources and attend an interactive workshop. A workplace mentoring meeting occurs mid-month and assessments and workbooks are due at the end of each month.</p>
<p><strong>Rolling enrolment</strong><br />Students start the relevant theory book for the unit that commences the month following their enrolment. An example being: if a student enrols in October they commence the unit <em>&lsquo;Design and implement the curriculum to foster children's learning and development&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;and attend the workshop on 1 November.</p></div>

<p><strong>Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) $145</strong> per unit<br />Please be advised that a RPL unit requires thorough assessment processes, and may require a combination of: completion of a workbook, evidence collection and workplace observation.</p>
<p><strong>Issuing Replacement Certificates $10</strong> per certificate <br />First Door will issue replacement certificates subject to receipt of a Statutory Declaration, stating previous enrolled name and address and current name and address and the reason for the replacement. The replacement certificate fee covers the cost of postage and handling.</p>
<p><strong>Fee Protection and Refunds</strong><br />All fees paid in advance are protected. We guarantee the company&rsquo;s sound financial position and safeguard all payments made in advance until the student&rsquo;s successful conclusion of units to the value of the advanced payment. If First Door has to cancel the course a full refund will be given, including all administration fees.</p>
<p>If a student provides one week notice to cancel prior to the course starting date, they will receive a full refund less the non-refundable enrolment fee. Cancellations after the course has begun will be dealt with on a case by case basis to ensure that First Door has done everything within its ability to assist the student in completing the course.</p></div>
