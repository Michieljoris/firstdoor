  <div id="mentor--">Your personal mentor
First Door undertakes to provide an arranged monthly workplace mentoring meeting for each student. Where this is not possible, due to the location of the centre, then a monthly skype or facetime meeting is arranged between student and mentor. This meeting allows for:
review of the student’s previous assessment and feedback
thirty minutes workplace observation and assessment
fifteen minutes to provide constructive feedback
assistance with understanding of the current workbook and assessment activities
guidance, inspiration and support for each student
</div>
</div>


<div scroll id="constructive"></div>
<div ng-show="isShow('constructive')" >
  <div id="constructive--">Constructive and timely assessment
Assessment is the process of gathering evidence to determine the competency of each student based on the National accredited training requirements. First Door undertakes to return student workbooks and assessment to the student within fourteen days of receipt. Assessment feedback is provided to guide a student on their progress and address any areas of difficulty. 

First Door assessment comprises of:
A paper workbook records:
evidence through the student’s handwritten account of workplace experiences that demonstrates the student’s required knowledge and ability to use the theory of the unit.
a workplace supervisor and First Door mentor’s assessment of student competency in workplace practice.
evidence of a student’s practical skills through documentation of workplace activities and in their reflective writing.
The workbook is submitted to First Door using the provided postage paid envelope.
Assessment tasks 
Wherever possible, assessment tasks are completed by students as computer documents and submitted to First Door by email. First Door attempts to make assessment questions/activities relevant to the student’s workplace experiences to provide the student with authentic learning and meaningful assessment.
