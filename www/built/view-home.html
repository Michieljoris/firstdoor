<h2>Your personal mentor</h2>
<p>First Door connects you with an industry experienced and qualified trainer as your personal mentor. Your personal mentor is available for study support and to provide workplace mentoring relevant to the current unit of study.<br /><br />We undertake to provide each student with an arranged monthly workplace mentoring meeting. Where this is not possible, due to the location of the student's workplace, then a monthly skype or facetime meeting is arranged between student and mentor. <br />This meeting allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>review of the student's previous assessment and feedback</li>
<li>thirty minutes workplace observation and assessment</li>
<li>fifteen minutes to provide constructive feedback</li>
<li>assistance with understanding of the current workbook and assessment activities</li>
<li>guidance, inspiration and support for each student<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<h2>Study support</h2>
<p>You have access to study support if you need assistance in understanding the information in the theory book or assessment workbook. Study support is available by phoning or emailing your mentor. Emails will be returned within 24 hours excluding on weekends and public holidays. Phone calls can be made between 9am and 6pm on weekdays. If your personal mentor is unavailable by phone they will return your call that same day.</p></div>

<h2>Workplace related, meaningful assessment</h2>
<p>Assessment is the process of gathering evidence to determine your competency based on the National accredited training requirements.&nbsp;First Door produces each unit's assessment workbook to ensure assessment questions/activities are relevant to the student&rsquo;s workplace experiences. We strive to provide each student with authentic learning and meaningful assessment.</p>
<p>Student assessment is completed in the individual unit's&nbsp;<strong><em>Workplace Activities and Assessment Workbook</em></strong></p>
<p>These workbooks are emailed to you at the completion of the previous unit. The structured training plan encourages students to submit their assessment by the end of each month, and students receive a new assessment workbook at the begining of each month. <br /><br />Where possible, all assessment workbooks are completed as a computer document and emailed back to your mentor. If you would prefer to complete a handwritten paper workbook then please advise your mentor.</p>
<p>Each assessment workbook consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Practical workplace activities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>evidence through your&nbsp;<em>workplace experiences</em>&nbsp;that demonstrates your required knowledge and ability to use the theory of the unit.</li>
<li>evidence of your&nbsp;<em>practical skills</em>&nbsp;relating to the theory of the unit. A workplace supervisor and/or First Door mentor assesses practical skills to ensure your competency in workplace practice.</li>
<li>attachment of your&nbsp;<em>portfolio evidence</em> through your&nbsp;<em>workplace documentation,</em>&nbsp;such as learning stories and reflective journals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li><strong>Assessment tasks:<br /></strong>These include a <em>report</em> or <em>journal</em> based from your workplace, and a <em>case study</em> that is discussed as a group at the workshop.<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<h3>Timely and constructive assessment of your work</h3>
<p>First Door undertakes to return your assessment workbook to you&nbsp;<strong>within fourteen days of receipt</strong> by First Door.&nbsp;Assessment feedback is provided to guide a student on their progress and address any areas of difficulty.</p></div>
