<h2>Engaging resources and environments</h2>

<h2>Your personal mentor</h2>
<p>First Door connects each student with an industry experienced and qualified trainer as your personal mentor. Your personal mentor is available for study support and to provide workplace mentoring relevant to the current unit of study.<br><br>We undertake to provide each student with an arranged monthly workplace mentoring meeting. Where this is not possible, due to the location of the student's workplace, then a monthly skype or facetime meeting is arranged between student and mentor. This meeting allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>review of the student's previous assessment and feedback</li>
<li>thirty minutes workplace observation and assessment</li>
<li>fifteen minutes to provide constructive feedback</li>
<li>assistance with understanding of the current workbook and assessment activities</li>

<h2>Constructive and timely assessment</h2>
<p>Assessment is the process of gathering evidence to determine the competency of each student based on the National accredited training requirements.&nbsp;First Door produces each unit's assessment workbook to ensure assessment questions/activities are relevant to the student&rsquo;s workplace experiences. We strive to provide each student with authentic learning and meaningful assessment.</p>
<p>Student assessment is completed in the individual unit's&nbsp;<strong><em>Workplace Activities and Assessment Workbook</em></strong></p>
<p>First Door assessment comprises of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Practical workplace activities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>evidence through the student&rsquo;s<em>&nbsp;account of workplace experiences</em>&nbsp;that demonstrates the student&rsquo;s required knowledge and ability to use the theory of the unit.</li>
<li>evidence of a student&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>practical skills</em>&nbsp;relating to the theory of the unit. A workplace supervisor and/or First Door mentor assesses practical skills to ensure student competency in workplace practice.</li>
<li>attachment of student's evidence through their&nbsp;<em>workplace documentation</em>&nbsp;such as learning stories and in their reflective writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li><strong>Assessment tasks:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Wherever possible, assessment tasks contained in the workbook are completed by students as a computer document and submitted to First Door by email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Door undertakes to return student workbooks and assessment to the student&nbsp;<strong>within fourteen days of receipt.</strong>&nbsp;Assessment feedback is provided to guide a student on their progress and address any areas of difficulty.</p></div>
