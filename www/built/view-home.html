Your personal mentor is available for study support and to provide workplace mentoring relevant to the current unit of study.<br /><br />We undertake to provide each student with an arranged monthly workplace mentoring meeting.

<div scroll id="constructive"></div>
<div ng-show="isShow('constructive')" >
  <div id="constructive--"><h2>Constructive and timely assessment</h2>
<p>Assessment is the process of gathering evidence to determine the competency of each student based on the National accredited training requirements.&nbsp;First Door produces each unit's assessment workbook to ensure assessment questions/activities are relevant to the student&rsquo;s workplace experiences. We strive to provide each student with authentic learning and meaningful assessment.</p>
<p>Student assessment is completed in the individual unit's&nbsp;<strong><em>Workplace Activities and Assessment Workbook</em></strong></p>
<p>First Door assessment comprises of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Practical workplace activities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>evidence through the student&rsquo;s<em>&nbsp;account of workplace experiences</em>&nbsp;that demonstrates the student&rsquo;s required knowledge and ability to use the theory of the unit.</li>
<li>evidence of a student&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>practical skills</em>&nbsp;relating to the theory of the unit. A workplace supervisor and/or First Door mentor assesses practical skills to ensure student competency in workplace practice.</li>
<li>attachment of student's evidence through their&nbsp;<em>workplace documentation</em>&nbsp;such as learning stories and in their reflective writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li><strong>Assessment tasks:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Wherever possible, assessment tasks contained in the workbook are completed by students as a computer document and submitted to First Door by email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Door undertakes to return student workbooks and assessment to the student&nbsp;<strong>within fourteen days of receipt.</strong>&nbsp;Assessment feedback is provided to guide a student on their progress and address any areas of difficulty.</p></div>

<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>Use these quiz results as a guide only&mdash;not as a fixed label. They can help you to discover ways that you learn best; they can also help you to experiment with new and different strategies and skills.</p>
<h2>If you scored mostly A&rsquo;s then you are an AUDITORY learner</h2>
<p><em>Auditory learners tend to benefit most from traditional teaching techniques. Many auditory learners tend to learn best when the trainer presents information by talking to their students. Regulating voice tone, inflection, and body language will help all students maintain interest and attention. Auditory learners succeed when directions are read aloud, speeches are required, or information is presented and requested verbally.</em></p>
<p><em>Learning Suggestions for Auditory Learners</em></p>
<p>Using word association to remember facts and lines</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording lectures</li>
<li>Watching videos</li>
<li>Repeating facts with eyes closed</li>
<li>Participating in group discussions</li>
<li>Using audiotapes for language practice</li>
<li>Taping notes after writing them</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you scored mostly B&rsquo;s then you are a VISUAL learner</h2>
<p><em>Some students rely upon a visual learning style: "Show me and I'll understand." Visual learners benefit from diagrams, charts, pictures, films, and written directions. These students will value to-do lists, assignment logs, and written notes. Many of these techniques, however, also benefit kinaesthetic learners.</em></p>
<p><em>Learning Suggestions for Visual Learners</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a map of events in history or draw scientific process</li>
<li>Make outlines of everything</li>
<li>Copy what's on the board</li>
<li>Ask the teacher to diagram</li>
<li>Diagram sentences and mind maps</li>
<li>Take notes, make lists, use post-it notes and place these in prominent places</li>
<li>Watch relevant videos</li>
<li>Colour code words</li>
<li>Outline reading</li>
<li>Use flashcards</li>
<li>Use highlighters, circle words, underline</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you scored mostly C&rsquo;s then you are a KINAESTHETIC learner</h2>
<p><em>Kinaesthetic learners are most successful when totally engaged with the learning activity. They acquire information fastest when participating in activity based learning, tactile learning or with hands-on teaching techniques.</em></p>
<p><em>Learning Suggestions for Kinaesthetic Learners</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Studying in short blocks</li>
<li>Role playing</li>
<li>Taking field trips, visiting museums</li>
<li>Studying with others</li>
<li>Using memory games</li>
<li>Using flash cards to memorize</li>
<li>Using motion in study, for example: walk and talk/read your notes, pass a small ball from one hand to the other or use a yo-yo while studying</li>
<li>Chew gum while studying, if appropriate</li>
</ul></div>
