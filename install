serves on port 9001
forever start proxy8080js
And redirect 80 to port 8080:

* How to bind to port 80,	     :reverse:proxy:iptables:port80:redirect:
or rather how to redirect it
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p tcp -

Short answer: you can't. Ports below 1024 can be opened only by root.

port 443 gets forwarded to 4443

The long answer: you can redirect connections on port 80 to some other port you can open as normal user.

Run as root:

# iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
NOTE: The above solution is not well suited for multi-user systems, as any user can open port 8080 (or any other high port you decide to use), thus intercepting the traffic. (Credits to CesarB).

EDIT: as per comment question - to delete the above rule:
]] iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
 [[
iptables -t nat --line-numbers -n -L
This will output something like:

Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
num  target     prot opt source               destination         
1    REDIRECT   tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:8080 redir ports 8088
2    REDIRECT   tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:80 redir ports 8080
The rule you are interested in is nr. 2, so to delete it:

# iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING 2

For instance: 
sudo redir --lport=80 --laddr=192.168.0.101 --cport 9990
--caddr=127.0.0.1
