<h2>Professional Development</h2>
<p><strong>Invite First Door to your Centre, and develop inspiration, practical skills and knowledge within your team.</strong> Our interactive two hour workshops can be booked individually or collectively. Each workshop builds from content and knowledge gained in the previous workshop. The entire Professional Development course provides an overview of the National Quality Standard and The Early Years Learning Framework. Progression through the course of workshops is recommended fortnightly, monthly or six weekly throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>We discuss and evaluate the complexity of the needs within the Centre, and the educators existing capability</strong> in the outlined topics with the Centre Director. This insight creates more relevant professional development, and occasionally a workshop is recommended over two sessions. Expanding over two sessions allows for broadening of concepts, strategies and discussions in the areas of need and increased development of practical skills.</p>

<p><strong>First Door are leaders in developing capability.</strong> To follow on from these workshops, templates are provided to allow for continued practise within your team. First Door provides social media environments to invite further learning through conversations with other educators. Continued desire to improve practices and stimulating conversations assist with ongoing changes in attitudes and actions that further develop your team’s capability.</p>

<p><strong>Professional development designed to meet your Centre’s needs.</strong> When the course of workshops are booked, First Door offers a complimentary customised workshop for your team that targets the specific needs of your Centre.</p>
