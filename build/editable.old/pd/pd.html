<h2>Interactive workshops tailored for your team&nbsp;</h2>
<p><strong>Develop capability within your team through First Door's professional development workshops at your centre</strong>&nbsp;<br />First Door delivers seven, two hour workshops that can be booked individually or as a series of workshops. These engaging workshops provide educators strategies to encompass the National Quality Framework into their practice. If booked as a series, each workshop builds from content and knowledge gained in the previous workshop. The speed of progression through the workshops is arranged to suit each individual Early Childhood centre or Outside School Hours Care service.</p>
<p>When the seven workshops are booked, First Door offers a complimentary customised workshop for your team that targets the specific needs of your Centre.<br /><br /><strong>First Door has a three step approach to ensure that the workshops are meeting the learning needs of your team:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Needs analysis of your team&rsquo;s prior knowledge, skills and understanding</strong> <br />First Door will consult with you relating to the complexity of the needs within the Centre, and the educators existing capability in the outlined topics. &nbsp;We then tailor each workshop to ensure the best fit to your team's developmental needs. Occasionally, if considered necessary, a workshop is recommended over two sessions. This allows for broadening of concepts, development of practical skills, strategies and discussions in the relevant areas.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong><strong>National Quality Framework related workshop series<br /></strong></strong>The workshops focus on a practical approach to bridge understanding of the National Quality Framework into educator's everyday practice.<strong><strong><br /><br /></strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Follow on learning for improved practice</strong><br />Templates to allow for continued practise within your team are provided by First Door to follow on from these workshops. First Door has a Facebook group and social media environments to invite further learning and conversations with other educators. Continued exposure to ideas for improved practice and stimulating conversations assist with ongoing changes in attitudes and actions to further develop your team&rsquo;s capability.<br /><br /></li>
