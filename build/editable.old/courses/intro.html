<h2>Nationally Recognised Training</h2>
<p>First Door is registered with the <a href="http://www.asqa.gov.au/">Australian Skills Quality Authority</a> as a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) to provide competency based and Nationally Recognised Training.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are currently enrolling students to commence training in the new <strong><em>CHC50113 <a href="http://www.firstdoor.com.au/#!/courses#children_ecec">Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care</a>. </em></strong>&nbsp;During the enrolment process each student will commence either a Structured or Flexi learning plan to best support their success. <br /><br />The Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care superseded the Diploma of Children's Services in July 2013 to ensure relevance to the <a href="http://acecqa.gov.au/national-quality-framework">National Quality Framework</a> that was introduced throughout Australian Early Childhood licensed centres in 2012. Full information relating to this new Diploma is able to be viewed at <a href="http://www.myskills.gov.au/QualificationSearch/QualificationSearchResults/QualificationDetail/UnitsofCompetency.aspx?type=course&amp;keys=CHC50113">My Skills</a> website.</p>
