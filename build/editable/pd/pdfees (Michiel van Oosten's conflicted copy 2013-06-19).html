Fees (new page)
Professional Development workshop fees 
The workshop fees cover the cost of:
An assessment of the group’s general prior knowledge and working skills prior to the workshop. This assessment relies on the centre Director completing the relevant workshop needs assessment form and submitting the form to First Door at least one week prior to the workshop date.
An interactive two hour presentation of the workshop at your centre using our data projector, screen and relevant resources
Supplied resources to each attending person
Certificate of participation to each attending person
Follow on templates to allow for continued practice
Access to First Door social networking and communication tools
Evaluation of the effectiveness of the workshop in improving your team’s knowledge, skills and capability 


Group size
First Door presents interactive professional development workshops and therefore prefers to have no more than twenty people in attendance. If your group size is larger than twenty please discuss this with us so that we can best accommodate your group.

Professional development workshop fee payment
Fee payments for professional development workshops are made in advance to First Door Training and Development Pty. Ltd. These are paid in two ways:

1. Payment of $400 prior to each single professional development workshop

2. Payment of $2,800 for the series of eight booked workshops. When the workshop series is booked and paid, the Centre will receive the customised professional development workshop, tailored to your centre’s needs, at NO CHARGE.
	
Advance fee payment protection 
All fees paid in advance are protected.  We guarantee the company’s sound financial position and safeguard all payments made in advance until the conclusion of the professional development workshops to the value of the advanced payment.

Cancellation refunds 
If First Door has to cancel the workshop an alternative suitable date will be arranged, or a full refund will be given.
 
If a Centre provides at least two weeks’ notice prior to the workshop to cancel and a suitable new booking date for the workshop is not achieved they will receive a full refund.  
A cancellation made by the Centre during the fortnight before the workshop is subject to a cancellation fee of $100.
