<h2>Our four step approach</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Invite First Door to your Centre, and develop capability within your team through our professional development workshops.</strong> These interactive two hour workshops can be booked individually or collectively. Each workshop builds from content and knowledge gained in the previous workshop. The progression through the workshops is recommended fortnightly, monthly or six weekly throughout the year.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Needs analysis: of your team&rsquo;s prior knowledge, skills and understanding</strong> <br />First Door will consult with you relating to the complexity of the needs within the Centre, and the educators existing capability in the outlined topics.&nbsp; Occasionally, a workshop is recommended over two sessions. This allows for broadening of concepts, development of practical skills, strategies and discussions in the areas of need.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Follow on learning: First Door are leaders in developing capability.</strong><br />Templates to allow for continued practise within your team are provided by First Door to follow on from these workshops. We provide social media environments to invite further learning through conversations with other educators. Continued exposure to ideas for improved practice and stimulating conversations assist with ongoing changes in attitudes and actions to further develop your team&rsquo;s capability.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Professional development designed to meet your Centre&rsquo;s needs</strong><br />When the seven workshops are booked, First Door offers a complimentary customised workshop for your team that targets the specific needs of your Centre.</li>
