<h2>Developing cooperative behaviour</h2>
<p>This workshop provides educators with strategies to refocus their approach to unacceptable behaviour, and proactively develop cooperative behaviour. It is recommended that this workshop be extended over four hours or over two sessions if educators are working reactively to complex behaviours and/or have limited understanding of these concepts. The EYLF PRINCIPLES are discussed, being: Secure, Respectful and Reciprocal Relationships; Partnerships; High Expectations and Equity; Respect for Diversity; and, Ongoing Learning and Reflective Practice.</p>
<h3>Topics include:</h3>
<h4>Setting up for success:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is the behaviour we are working towards? Establish positively stated guidelines relevant to the ability, culture and background of the children and policies of the centre</li>
<li>Engaging collaborative decision making of rules/expectations and strategies to gain children&acirc;&euro;&trade;s understanding and acceptance of rules/expectations</li>
<li>Commitment to consistency within the team of educators.</li>
<li>Boundary testing and strategies to use.</li>
<li>Modelling respectful and cooperative behaviour through meaningful and respectful relationships with each child, where educators understand each child.</li>

<h4>Understanding the child and their behaviour:</h4>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4>Develop, implement and evaluate a plan for cooperative behaviour</h4>
<ul>
<li>Interpret the child's behaviour with other involved educators and relevant others.</li>
<li>Work in partnership with parents, and develop a plan collaboratively, in accordance with philosophy and policies of the service</li>
