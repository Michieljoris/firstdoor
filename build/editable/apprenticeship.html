Who is involved in an apprenticeship training program?
An apprenticeship is a three way partnership between the student, their employer and the Registered Training Organisation (First Door).

There are other people that will be involved in ensuring that you are progressing through your apprenticeship training. These parties are:

Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)
DETE fund the Apprenticeship program and are responsible for ensuring all regulations are met in your training experience.

Australian Apprenticeship Centre (AAC)
AAC are contracted businesses by the Government (e.g. Sarina Russo, Busy at Work and MEGT) that are responsible for registering you as an apprentice with a Registered Training Organisation and your employer. The AAC also monitors your apprenticeship progress.

Registered Training Organisation (RTO) and Pre-qualified Supplier
First Door is an approved RTO through the Australian Skills Quality Authority to provide Nationally Registered Training and Assessment. We are also a Pre-qualified Supplier approved through the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) to provide apprenticeship training in the Diploma of Early Childhood Education and Care.

Your employer
Your employer needs to agree to provide the workplace for your ‘on-the-job training’ and the payment of your wage. The responsibility of your employer is to provide skills based training in the workplace and to provide you with the paid time to attend the required ‘off the job training’ with First Door. 
Off the job training hours with First Door for each month/unit of study hours include a:
Five hour interactive workshop
One hour mentoring meeting

For this responsibility, your employer receives incentive payment/s from the Government to provide apprenticeship training.

The employer can choose whether to:
employ a new staff member under an Apprenticeship contract, or 
sign an apprenticeship contract with an existing worker that has been employed for more than three full-time equivalent months.

Workplace supervisor
Your workplace supervisor  will assist First Door in assessing your practical skills at work. A workplace supervisor must be qualified to Diploma level, and be able to observe your related skills as competent before they are able to sign off your practical skills.
