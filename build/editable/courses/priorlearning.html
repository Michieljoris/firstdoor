<h2>Recognition of Prior Learning</h2>
<p>Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a process where a student may be granted credit towards a qualification in recognition of skills and knowledge gained through formal or informal training, work and/or life experience. RPL is offered to any student who can provide evidence of competency for the units offered within the Diploma of Children&rsquo;s Services qualification.</p>
<p>During the enrolment process a potential Learner may complete a checklist and discuss any prior evidence before commencing training to determine if they are eligible for RPL. To receive a RPL for a unit requires thorough assessment processes. To display RPL competency, students may need to: collect and provide evidence, complete a workbook and/or be observed in the workplace.</p>
