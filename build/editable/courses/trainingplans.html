<h2>Training Plans</h2>
<p>You will have 24 months to complete your Diploma in Children&rsquo;s Services course from your enrolment date.&nbsp; We have a continual intake of students on this basis throughout the year. For more information on choosing your best suited training plans please refer to your First Door student handbook.</p>
<h3>Flexi training plan</h3>
<p>The Flexi plan suits students that are eligible to RPL course unit/s, are highly self-motivated and need flexibility to set their own assessment due dates. Flexi students set their own timetable providing they are able to complete the course within two years. The flexi course follows the four part course structure excluding any RPL units.</p>
<p>The monthly meeting with the student&rsquo;s personal mentor enables goal setting and assessment due dates to be established. Where possible, Flexi students choose units that are in sync with the structured plan so that they can attend relevant workshops. Flexi student are encouraged to attend at least twelve of the eighteen workshops provided for this course.</p>
<h3>Structured training plan</h3>
<p><strong>Monthly timetable</strong><br />The structured plan provides students with a monthly timetable to work through a course unit each month from February to November. Our structured plan allows for the 18 units to be completed within two years combining part time study and work experience. Studying using this plan assists students to stay focused and motivated.</p>
<p>One unit is completed each month, excluding the months of December and January each year. At the beginning of each month, students receive their new unit resources and attend an interactive workshop. A workplace mentoring meeting occurs mid-month and assessments and workbooks are due at the end of each month.</p>
<p><strong>Rolling enrolment</strong><br />Students start the relevant theory book for the unit that commences the month following their enrolment. An example being: if a student enrols in October they commence the unit &lsquo;Gather, interpret and use information about children&rsquo; and attend the workshop on 1 November.</p>
