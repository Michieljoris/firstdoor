<h2>Your personal mentor</h2>
<p>First Door connects each student with an industry experienced and qualified trainer as your personal mentor. Your personal mentor is available for study support and to provide workplace mentoring relevant to the current unit of study.<br /><br />We undertake to provide each student with an arranged monthly workplace mentoring meeting. Where this is not possible, due to the location of the student's workplace, then a monthly skype or facetime meeting is arranged between student and mentor. This meeting allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>review of the student's previous assessment and feedback</li>
<li>thirty minutes workplace observation and assessment</li>
<li>fifteen minutes to provide constructive feedback</li>
<li>assistance with understanding of the current workbook and assessment activities</li>
<li>guidance, inspiration and support for each student<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
