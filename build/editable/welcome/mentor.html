<h2>Your personal mentor</h2>
<p>First Door connects you with an industry experienced and qualified trainer as your personal mentor. Your personal mentor is available for study support and to provide workplace mentoring relevant to the current unit of study.<br /><br />We undertake to provide each student with an arranged monthly workplace mentoring meeting. Where this is not possible, due to the location of the student's workplace, then a monthly skype or facetime meeting is arranged between student and mentor. <br />This meeting allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>review of the student's previous assessment and feedback</li>
<li>thirty minutes workplace observation and assessment</li>
<li>fifteen minutes to provide constructive feedback</li>
<li>assistance with understanding of the current workbook and assessment activities</li>
<li>guidance, inspiration and support for each student<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<h2>Study support</h2>
<p>You have access to study support if you need assistance in understanding the information in the theory book or assessment workbook. Study support is available by phoning or emailing your mentor. Emails will be returned within 24 hours excluding on weekends and public holidays. Phone calls can be made between 9am and 6pm on weekdays. If your personal mentor is unavailable by phone they will return your call that same day.</p>
