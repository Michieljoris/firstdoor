<h2>Constructive and timely assessment</h2>
<p>Assessment is the process of gathering evidence to determine the competency of each student based on the National accredited training requirements.&nbsp;First Door produces each unit's assessment workbook to ensure assessment questions/activities are relevant to the student&rsquo;s workplace experiences. We strive to provide each student with authentic learning and meaningful assessment.</p>
<p>Student assessment is completed in the individual unit's&nbsp;<strong><em>Workplace Activities and Assessment Workbook</em></strong></p>
<p>First Door assessment comprises of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Practical workplace activities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>evidence through the student&rsquo;s<em>&nbsp;account of workplace experiences</em>&nbsp;that demonstrates the student&rsquo;s required knowledge and ability to use the theory of the unit.</li>
<li>evidence of a student&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>practical skills</em>&nbsp;relating to the theory of the unit. A workplace supervisor and/or First Door mentor assesses practical skills to ensure student competency in workplace practice.</li>
<li>attachment of student's evidence through their&nbsp;<em>workplace documentation</em>&nbsp;such as learning stories and in their reflective writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li><strong>Assessment tasks:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Wherever possible, assessment tasks contained in the workbook are completed by students as a computer document and submitted to First Door by email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Door undertakes to return student workbooks and assessment to the student&nbsp;<strong>within fourteen days of receipt.</strong>&nbsp;Assessment feedback is provided to guide a student on their progress and address any areas of difficulty.</p>
