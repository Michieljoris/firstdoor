Your personal mentor
First Door undertakes to provide an arranged monthly workplace mentoring meeting for each student. Where this is not possible, due to the location of the centre, then a monthly skype or facetime meeting is arranged between student and mentor. This meeting allows for:
review of the studentâ€™s previous assessment and feedback
thirty minutes workplace observation and assessment
fifteen minutes to provide constructive feedback
assistance with understanding of the current workbook and assessment activities
guidance, inspiration and support for each student
