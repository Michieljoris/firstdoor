##Professional Development
**Invite First Door to your Centre, and develop inspiration, practical skills and knowledge within your team.** Our interactive two hour workshops can be booked individually or collectively. Each workshop builds from content and knowledge gained in the previous workshop. The entire Professional Development course provides an overview of the National Quality Standard and The Early Years Learning Framework. Progression through the course of workshops is recommended fortnightly, monthly or six weekly throughout the year.

**We discuss and evaluate the complexity of the needs within the Centre, and the educators existing capability** in the outlined topics with the Centre Director. This insight creates more relevant professional development, and occasionally a workshop is recommended over two sessions. Expanding over two sessions allows for broadening of concepts, strategies and discussions in the areas of need and increased development of practical skills.

**First Door are leaders in developing capability.** To follow on from these workshops, templates are provided to allow for continued practise within your team. First Door provides social media environments to invite further learning through conversations with other educators. Continued desire to improve practices and stimulating conversations assist with ongoing changes in attitudes and actions that further develop your team’s capability.

**Professional development designed to meet your Centre’s needs.** When the course of workshops are booked, First Door offers a complimentary customised workshop for your team that targets the specific needs of your Centre.

##Workshop Four: 
###Developing Cooperative Behaviour

This workshop provides educators with strategies to refocus their approach to unacceptable behaviour, and proactively develop cooperative behaviour. It is recommended that this workshop be extended over four hours or over two sessions if educators are working reactively to complex behaviours and/or have limited understanding of these concepts. 
The EYLF PRINCIPLES are discussed, being: Secure, Respectful and Reciprocal Relationships; Partnerships; High Expectations and Equity; Respect for Diversity; and, Ongoing Learning and Reflective Practice.

###Topics include:
####Setting up for success:
- What is the behaviour we are working towards? Establish positively stated guidelines relevant to the ability, culture and background of the children and policies of the centre

- Commitment to consistency within the team of educators.
- Boundary testing and strategies to use.
- Modelling respectful and cooperative behaviour through meaningful and respectful relationships with each child, where educators understand each child. 
- Using positive language: learning to rephrase instructions and use feedback sandwiches. 
- Fix basic physiological needs first. Provide security, acceptance, comfort and a sense of belonging. 
- Proactive approaches: positive reinforcement, redirecting to tasks of interest, providing choices and logical consequences.
####Understanding the child and their behaviour:
- Understanding from the child’s perspective. What does the child want/need/expect to happen? 
- Observe and analyse behaviour to identify triggers and patterns. 
- Use reflective practice to analyse the child’s needs and their reinforcers or consequences which are maintaining the behaviour.
- Review program routines and timetabling for possible influence on behaviour

####Develop, implement and evaluate a plan for cooperative behaviour
- Interpret the child's behaviour with other involved educators and relevant others.
- Work in partnership with parents, and develop a plan collaboratively, in accordance with philosophy and policies of the service 
- Clearly identify strategies to achieve acceptable alternative behaviours in the plan
- Use ongoing evaluation and revise the plan as required.
