<p>Choosing a job role to enrich and touch people’s lives is a career choice that has the ability to impact on individuals, communities and our society.</p>

<p>As trainers of the people working in Community Services we are passionate about inspiring students and creating competence. First Door is committed to developing capability in the Community services workforce. </p>

<p>Our students are supported to achieve much more than a certificate. On completion of a course each student will understand the full scope and impact of their job role. They will have the knowledge, skills and capability required that enables them to enrich lives and benefit others.</p>
